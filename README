CurrencyChart
=====================================

Written in two days.

This application comprises a java backend and a javascript/HTML frontend.

This application is developed on the Play 2.0 framework and requires Play 2.0 to run. 

To run the application, browse to the source directory and execute "play compile" (for first execution) and then "play run".

The application will request the latest ECB trading figures for the Euro against various currencies and display a chart based on this data comparing the current EUR value in USD.

The chart can be viewed at localhost:9000

TODO:

*Improve business logic to allow users to specify currency.

*Tidy up XML parsing



It's awesome.
